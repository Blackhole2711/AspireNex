For this dataset in sales prediction using python, we used SARIMAX and XGBoost models to predict sales. We first loaded the data set and cleaned it,
handling null values, then we performed exploratory analysis on the data to find trend and seasonality, we did correlation analysis and time series analysis 
and also tested its stationarity using Dickey-Fuller test, and we found the following insights:
1. Storetype a has highest customer and salesÂ¶
2. Storetype b has highest SalesPerCustomer
3. There is no promotion offer in Saturday and Sunday
4. Customers are going to buy their goods in tuesday on promotional offer.
Then, we fit our data using SARIMAX, making acf and pacf plots, and then fit our data into a model using XGBoost then we hyperytuned that model and after
hypertuning, we were able to reduce RMSE from 1216.08 to 1106.41 which is better.
